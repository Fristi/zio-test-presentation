zio-test workshop
---

In this workshop I'll go over some basic ZIO and how we could test this

### zio-test features

- Composable tests combinators
- Test aspects, which annotate tests with `timeout`, `repeat`, `retry` or `flaky`
- Dynamic test generation
- Built-in property-based testing
- Sharing `ZLayer` instances
- Resource management 
- Testable versions of `System`, `Clock`, `Random`, etc
- Test reporting utilities like `zio.test.diff.Diff`
